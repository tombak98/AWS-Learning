# AWS Practice Application

## Link to the application:
https://dev.d3h9i1asveh72v.amplifyapp.com

1. While this uses react, it doesnt yet self compile on AWS Amplify. So, have to manually compile it locally first
2. Then, you zip up the html, bundle, and css files and upload that to the AWS Amplify App
